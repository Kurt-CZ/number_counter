Write a program which would go through a sequence of digits and add up those digits that match the next digit in the sequence. The sequence is circular - the last digit and the first digit are next to each other.

1133 equals 4: the first 1 is followed by another 1 (sum = 1 ), the second one is not followed by another 1 (sum is still 1), 3 is followed by 3 (sum= 1+ 3), the last 3 is followed by 1 (still sum = 4)        

1111 equals 4 because all the 1s are followed by the same digit
4567 equals 0 because no digit matches the next
96767679 equals 9 because the only digit that is followed by the same digit is 9.
